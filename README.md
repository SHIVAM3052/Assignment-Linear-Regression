## Conclusions
- The reason for choosing Ridge over Lasso in this case is mainly because Ridge performed better in terms of RMSE and R-squared. A lower RMSE indicates that the Ridge model's predictions are closer to the actual target values, and a higher R-squared suggests that the Ridge model explains more of the variance in the target variable.
